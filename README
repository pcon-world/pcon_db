##### 2. Agent of the Portal (client application) - installed on the user's local machine, performs the function of an agent, promptly notifying the user of changes, has tools for working with the repository and work copy;

## Tasks
##### 1. Organization of the exchange of data between team (or jobs of one engineer),
##### 2. Version control of project files,
##### 3. View history and authors of changes and other data,
##### 4. Informing project participants about changes in data,
##### 5. Protection against accidental data intention;

## Using the solution:
##### 1. Reduce the complexity of the exchange of information
##### 2. Save all versions and project changes
##### 3. Simplify change analysis
##### 4. Increase productivity
##### 5. Differentiate access rights to data
